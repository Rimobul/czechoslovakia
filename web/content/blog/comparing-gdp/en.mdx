# Introduction

Since the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, both countries have taken their own economic paths. The Czech Republic maintained its position as the stronger economy, while Slovakia experienced dynamic growth especially after joining the European Union.

## Historical Context

At the time of the split, Slovakia was industrially less developed than the Czech lands. Heavy industry and arms manufacturing, on which Slovakia depended, were undergoing painful restructuring.
