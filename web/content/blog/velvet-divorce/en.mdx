# A Unique Separation in History

On January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia ceased to exist and two new states were born: the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. This process, known as the "Velvet Divorce", was unique in its peacefulness.

## The Road to Separation

Tension between the Czech and Slovak parts of the federation had been growing since the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The main points of contention were:

- Economic differences between the two parts of the country
- The question of Slovak autonomy
- Different visions for the country's direction

> "The separation was inevitable, but the way it happened was exemplary for the whole world." — Historian

## Negotiations

The key figures in the negotiations were Václav Klaus and Vladimír Mečiar. Despite having different political views, they managed to agree on a peaceful separation.

### Main Points of Agreement

1. Fair division of assets (2:1 in favor of Czech Republic)
2. Maintaining customs union
3. Citizenship for all former ČSFR citizens
4. Open borders

## Consequences of the Split

### Positive

- Both nations gained full sovereignty
- Slovakia could pursue its own economic policy
- Political frictions disappeared

### Negative

- Separation of some families
- Loss of common market (temporarily)
- Need to build new institutions

## 30 Years Later

Today, relations between the two countries are excellent. Czechs and Slovaks consider each other the closest nation, and cooperation takes place at all levels.
