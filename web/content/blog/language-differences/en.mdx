# Two Languages, One Root

Czech and Slovak belong to the West Slavic language group and are close enough that speakers can usually understand each other without translation. Nevertheless, there are interesting differences.

## Historical Development

Both languages developed together until the 19th century, when codification of literary forms occurred. Slovak was influenced by Hungarian, while Czech was influenced by German.

## Funny "False Friends"

Some words look the same but have completely different meanings:

| Czech word | Meaning in Czech | Slovak meaning |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Horký | Hot | Bitter |
| Ovoce | Fruits | Vegetables |
| Kapusta | Cabbage | Cauliflower |
| Žehlit | To iron | To stroke hair |

## Grammatical Differences

### Suffixes

- CZ: -ice → SK: -ica (ulice/ulica)
- CZ: -ství → SK: -stvo (umělectví/umělectvo)

### Soft Consonants

Slovak has softer pronunciation of some sounds, for example "ď", "ť", "ň" are more common than in Czech.

## Mutual Understanding

Younger generations of Czechs and Slovaks who grew up after the split sometimes have trouble understanding each other. The older generation, thanks to shared television and radio, passively understands both languages.

> "When a Czech speaks slowly and a Slovak adjusts their vocabulary a bit, they understand each other without problems." — Linguist

## Conclusion

The linguistic proximity of Czech and Slovak is unique and represents an important bond between both nations. It is important to maintain this closeness for future generations as well.
